# WeTunes
"My music player, titled WeTunes, is designed to be inspired by Spotify. It is an imperfect responsive website, so the design may not fit some screen sizes, but it is optimized for 1920 x 1080 resolutions."

Features includes:

Wave - refers to a visual effect that likely indicates that music is currently playing. It is a visual representation of sound waves or an equalizer effect. This visual element adds dynamism to my music player interface, giving users a visual cue that music is playing.
Updating Time - which continuously updates the current time of the playing music, calculates progress, and updates the progress bar accordingly.
Seek - allowing users to seek to a specific point in the music track.
Keyboard Controls - specifically the spacebar, for playing and pausing music.
Volume Control - Functionality for controlling the volume using a slider and muting/unmuting the audio. Though it is imperfect, it still functions well; only the icon changes are the problem. Hit the icon once, and then it will mute as the icon changes to mute and turns green. If you hit it again, it will go back to being unmuted. You can also use the slider to adjust the volume to your preferred loudness.
Skip and Back Buttons - for skipping to the next or previous track in the playlist.
Shuffle Functionality - This feature shuffles songs in the playlist and plays them randomly. It also includes a combination of shuffle and next, where the shuffle function picks another random song.
Repeat Functionality - This feature allows for repeating the currently playing song. Additionally, if shuffle is enabled and the repeat function is activated, the system prioritizes the repeat, disabling the shuffle function. 
Highlighting Current Song - A function to highlight the currently playing song in the playlist.
